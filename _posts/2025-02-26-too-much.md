# Sometimes it's better to rest

I mean you, not me.



## ideas

* Why I am still using jekyll for my engine for blog?! Not sure why I didn't move for some blog tool like a VuePress or Astro? TODO: Check for alternatives.

## achievements



## learnings
* 
* how to install jekyll, ruby, and run locally to check why it's not working `jekyll build --verbose`, [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/), THAT INSTALLATION WAS VERY SLLLOOOOWWWWW, python UV is much faster -> python 1:0 ruby
* micro sd cards meaning [https://www.zdnet.com/article/deciphering-microsd-card-and-sd-card-storage-jargon/](https://www.zdnet.com/article/deciphering-microsd-card-and-sd-card-storage-jargon/)
* my friend create b2b company, learning, links maybe for future me, mostly for Polish b2b contractors
  * to create company you need to do it on biznes.gov to create application CEIDG, [https://www.biznes.gov.pl/pl](https://www.biznes.gov.pl/pl)
  * accounting inFakt or iFirma, Friend choose inFakt from recommendation
  * probalby good idea before whole process create company is to go to tax advisor, he will help you with details decisions what to choose for example be VAT payer or not, what kind of company to create, what tax form to choose, flat or maybe lump sum tax (Ryczałt)
  * ranking banks for new company [https://www.bankier.pl/smart/konta-firmowe](https://www.bankier.pl/smart/konta-firmowe)
* don't turn of in iphone voLTE - voice over internet
* iphone battery sucks
  * my iphone XR suck but still working, induction charging is aweful but phone is from 11.2020 :D 
  * Probably about April or November I will buy new one

## finds

* Go deeper with Protocols in Python
  * Protocols from Python 3.8

protocols same signature, use duck typing :O no inheritance needed, more flexible
start use more protocols
yu can use Protocols like Abstract Classes, but need to remeber to add in protocol abstract class

less coupling with protocols than with abstract classes

"My practical conclusion to this question is basically, if the classes you want to interface with follow a strict hierarchy and are implemented with your specific application in mind, use ABC's. 


If you want to interface with more generalized classes that may or may not be intended specifically with your application in mind, but you do care about them implementing some specific methods, use protocols.

TLDR: Protocols if you want to interface with other peoples classes ABC's to interface with your own classes"

if you want to check if isinstance() use abc
from default use protocols

shallow hierarchy use protocols, deep hierarchy use abc, prefer protocols easier to maintian
rruntable_chackable from typing :O

|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Definition                       | Defined using `typing.Protocol`                | Defined using `abc.ABC`                        |
| Purpose                          | Structural subtyping                           | Nominal subtyping                              |
| Inheritance                      | Implicitly implemented by matching attributes  | Explicitly implemented by subclassing          |
| Use Case                         | Interface-like behavior                        | Enforcing method implementation                |

| Method Implementation            | Methods can have default implementations       | Abstract methods must be overridden            |
| Type Checking                    | Used for static type checking                  | Used for both static type checking and runtime |
